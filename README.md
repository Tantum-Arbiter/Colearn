**Paper**: **Bridging the Gap Between Screen Time Risks & Development Potential:** Designing a WHO & EAP Aligned, Research-Driven App for Toddlers, addressing Passive Screen Use in Early Childhood through supporting Co-Engagement, Sensory, Emotional & Language Development.

# Aim

To design, develop and evaluate a child **e-learning application for toddlers aged 12-36 months**, supporting co-engagement, emotional, sensory and language development, whilst aligning with WHO/EAP screen-time guidelines and addressing risks from passive screen time exposure through interactive, guided and safe parent-child digital media experiences.
Objectives
1.	Design and develop a functional prototype of a personalised, research-driven co-engaged learning application for toddlers, incorporating narrative storybooks, sensory games and emotional expression experiences.
2.	Evaluate the developmental alignment and usability of the app through expert feedback, research-driven features, parent interviews and comparison with existing guidelines.
3.	Assess the applicationâ€™s potential to mitigate detrimental impacts associated with passive screen usage and promote parent-child interaction through co-engaged experiences, utilising qualitative user feedback and observational methods to ensure confidence in a safe product.
4.	Design and implement a cloud-based, highly available, reliable and resilient headless architecture within a distributed systems/microservice context.
5.	Establish a thorough Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline with a well-tested path-to-production process for front-end and back-end services with clear deployment/rollback strategies.
6.	Establish service reliability and meet end-user expectations by defining Service Level Indicators (SLIs), Service Level Agreements (SLAs), Service Level Objectives (SLOs), observability and monitoring, alerting and recovery strategies.
